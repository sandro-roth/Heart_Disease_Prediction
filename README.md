## Project Overview

This Project aims to develop a model for predicting heart disease. It uses different Classification Algorithms from
sklearn. For the current state of the Project 3 Models are applied (Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors and
Random Forest). The origin of the Data is UCI Heart Disease Dataset [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease]
